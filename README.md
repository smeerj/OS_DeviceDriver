# CSC415-Device-Drive

**Task**:

Develop a device driver that can be loaded and run in Linux.  Then add some functionality to the device driver such as the user/application passing in a string to the device driver and the device driver returns an encrypted version of the string or passes in the excrypted string and returns the original string.  Include a document on how to build, load and interact with the device driver (after the description in the write up template) along with screen shots of output.
